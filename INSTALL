The following steps are necessary to install the LINBOv3 Client GUI
inside the LINBO Client:

 * Install and configure Apache 2 and mod wsgi. An example Apache 
   configuration is provided in the conf subdirectory.

 * The following python modules need to be installed on the client
   system:

     - Django (V1.5.4+)
     - Django-Dajax
     - Django-Dajaxice

   Python pip should care for the dependencies. The file

    djanco-static/dajaxice.core.js

   must be copied to the Django static files directory.

 * Copy the Foundation framework to 

     MEDIA_URL/css (CSS part)
     MEDIA_URL/js (JS part)

 * Copy jquery, jquery.dajax.core.js and dajaxice.core.js to

     MEDIA_URL/js
   
 * Copy the linboweb directory to the paths matching your wsgi 
   configuration and adapt settings.py

   SITE_MEDIA is located at /srv/www/site_media/
   STATIC_URL is located at /srv/django/static

 * The Client code is not using a database. Simply ignore the 
   database settings.
